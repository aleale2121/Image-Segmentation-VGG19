# Cityscape Analysis Analysis using VGG19 Model

This project involves image segmentation using VGG19, a powerful technique for identifying objects in images and commonly used in various applications, including semantic segmentation. The image segmentation is performed using the cityscape dataset. Image recognition and cityscape analysis are key topics in the development of smart and sustainable modern urbanization, with the VGG19 Image Recognition Model expected to serve as a powerful tool to identify objects, features, and characteristics in cityscapes.
